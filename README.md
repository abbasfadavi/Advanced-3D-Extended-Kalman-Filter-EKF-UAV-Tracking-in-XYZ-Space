# Advanced-3D-Extended-Kalman-Filter-EKF-UAV-Tracking-in-XYZ-Space
This project implements an **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** for **3D UAV tracking** in Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z).   The nonlinear UAV motion model is simulated in MATLAB, and the EKF algorithm is implemented in **C/C++ for Vivado HLS**, suitable for FPGA acceleration.
