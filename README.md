# üõ∞Ô∏è Advanced 3D Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) ‚Äî UAV Tracking in XYZ Space

## üìò Overview
This project implements an **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** for **3D UAV tracking** in Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z).  
The nonlinear UAV motion model is simulated in MATLAB, and the EKF algorithm is implemented in **C/C++ for Vivado HLS**, suitable for FPGA acceleration.

It extends previous projects:
